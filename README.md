# Customer Churn Prediction Model

This is a Machine Learning (ML) model that uses different algorithms to predict a customer's churn (yes/no).
Below is a brief description of the dataset:
Customers who left within the last month – the column is called Churn
Services that each customer has signed up for – phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies
Customer account information – how long they’ve been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges
Demographic info about customers – gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents
The different algorithms used are LogisticRegressionCV, AdaBoostClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, and SupportVectorMachines. 
LogisticRegressionCV outperformed the other algorithms by achieving an accuracy of 82.044 %.
